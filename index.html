    <p id="text">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.It powers dynamic behavior on websites (like this one) and plays an important role in many fields, like front- and back-end engineering, game and mobile development, virtual reality, and more. In this course, you'll learn JavaScript fundamentals that will be helpful as you dive deeper into more advanced topics.</p>
